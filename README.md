# Purpose
This is an implementation of Radix Sort, using Counting Sort as the subroutine. It works for arrays with numbers ranging from 1-9999 (default array length is 8, this and the upper bounds can be changed if wanted). 

## How to Run
Simply compile RadixSort.java and CountingSort.java and run RadixSort :)
